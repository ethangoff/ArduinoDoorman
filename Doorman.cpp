//		Main system update method		//
//The system operates in 3 modes -
//	Normal Mode: checks entered keys against the keychain
//	Public Access Mode: opens the door at any keypress
//	Programming Mode: adds novel keys to the keychain or removes existing keys
//
//After the initial setup, the system simply cycles through this method repetatively.
//First, the system checks the two mode control switches to see if the mode should
//be changed before continuing. Then the system updates the mode indication LED if
//needed. Then, the system probes the Keypad, acting on a meaningful receipt as the
//current mode implies.

	//	or a c-string terminator to indacte nothing is received

	//	override switch is active, we open the door without further checks.
